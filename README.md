# hello-world
New setup
My name is Kat and I am a brand new programmer. I am an IT Recruiter and started taking classes in HTML and CSS to understand the people I was recruiting better and turns out I really like programming. I want to learn it and make a career shift as soon as I can. 
I also love Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and my 2 cats
I think I have the profile to be a decent programmer
